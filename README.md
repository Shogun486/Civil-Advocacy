This app allows a user to search up political figures in the USA, their office positions, party informartion, contact information, and social media outlets.
Searches can be done by using the current location of the device, entering a zip code, city, or state.
The UI of this application is minimal to convey the relevant information in a readable manner. 
The goal of this application is to make citizens more knowledgable about politicians not just at the national level, but also at the state and local levels.
This can raise political awareness and allow everyone to stay in-the-know.
