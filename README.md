Civil-Advocacy
==========

This Android app allows a user to search up political figures in the USA, their office positions, party informartion, contact information, and social media outlets.
Searches can be done by using the current location of the device, entering a zip code, city, or state.
The UI of this application is minimal to convey the relevant information in a readable manner. 
The goal of this application is to make citizens more knowledgable about politicians not just at the national level, but also at the state and local levels.
This can raise political awareness and allow everyone to stay in-the-know.

## Tools

This app is programmed entirely in Java. The
following libraries are utilized:
  * Volley (API calls)
  * Picasso (for image displays)

## Running the App

Simply install Android Studio --> Build Clean Project --> Run on an emulator of your choice
(this app has been tested on multiple devices with multiple screen sizes,
so feel free to run the app on any device you choose)
